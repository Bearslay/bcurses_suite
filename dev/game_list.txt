// VERSUS GAMES
//
// All games shall include computer bot(s) that can supplement a lack of other real people (like friends)

- tic tac toe
    - 1 or 2 players
    - modes
        - classic
        - X's only
    - presets
        - grid range of 3x3 to 49x49
            - larger grid sizes are probably only interesting for the X's only mode tbh

- connect 4
    - 1 or 2 players
    - presets
        - classic
        - custom
            - min grid size of 8x6 (normal), max of 12x8 perhaps

- shake bingo (cs special)
    - 1 or 2 players
    - presets
        - classic (2d6, 6x6 grid)
        - custom
            - min die amount of 1, max of 4
            - min die faces of 4, max of 20
            - optional modification: "wild" face is its own value and the amount of wild faces available are computed with: [# of wilds] = [die faces] / 6 (+1 if result is 0)

- stay alive
    - 1 to 4 players
    - presets
        - classic board (need to record combinations)
        - randomly generate board

- chess
    - 1 or 2 players (will probably lack a smart computer if one at all for now lmao)
    - modes
        - classic chess
            - including modern rules like en passant, castling, etc
            - timer settings will be available with presets like bullet/blitz/etc
        - chess variants
            - duck chess (this one is most chill i think)
            - spell chess? (clash of clans spells)
            - ability chess? (the one with mana and selected special abilities for pieces)
            - challenge chess (each player is given a random special challenge to play around of semi-similar difficulty)

- checkers
    - 1 or 2 players
    - presets
        - classic (i think; kings are obtained upon promotion)
        - alt classic (all checkers are kings from the start)

//
// PUZZLE GAMES
//
// All games are 1-player only and will probably involve random generation to ensure replayability

- gerrymandering game
    - idea
        - randomly generated board of 2 cell types is created with the goal of making any number of regions containing said cells
        - all regions must contain the same number of cells in them and may not have equal amounts of each cell type in a region
        - at the end, the minority cell type must have a majority "vote" by having more regions where the minority is the majority
            - needs more research to make sure that generated boards are possible 100% of the time and that minimum number of minority cells are used each time
    - game making
        - grid range from 6x6 to 32x32

- 2048
    - presets
        - classic (4x4 grid, summon either a 2 or a 4 per move)
        - do research on other popular 2048 presets/gamemodes

- pipe re-arrangement game
    - idea
        - generate several "trees of pipes" within a grid using intersections and stuff, then randomly rotate each cell to scramble the puzzle and make a new board
        - player needs to rotate each pipe to the correct orientation to make everything connect
    - presets
        - min grid size of 4x4, max of 64x64

- minesweeper
    - classic presets
        - beginner: 9x9 grid w/ 10 mines
        - intermediate: 16x16 grid w/ 40 mines
        - expert: 30x16 grid w/ 99 mines
    - user presets
        - grid range from 8x8 to 100x100
        - mines range from 1 to 99999 (max = cells in grid minus 1)
        - also give "density slider" to calculate mine count from grid size and given slider value

- mastermind
    - classic presets
        - beginner: 6 blanks, 8 colors, 12 guesses, no repeats
        - intermediate: 6 blanks, 8 colors, 12 guesses, possible repeats
        - expert: 6 blanks, 8 colors, 10 guesses, possible repeats
    - user presets
        - blank range from 5 to 10
        - color range from 6 to 16
        - guess range from 4 to 50
        - allow/disallow repeats
            - exact quantities may need playtesting

- hangman
    - idea
        - load in a text file or something of a whole bunch of words to randomly select from
        - otherwise, its just hangman lol

//
// MISC GAMES/PROGRAMS
//
// These games/programs don't fall into any other category

- conway's game of life
    - exactly what it sounds like, might need a lot of developing to get it into a good form with an 'infinite" expanse
    - potentially look into other cellular automata simulation games
